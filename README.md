# Instagram Web Clone

This project is a **web-based clone of the Instagram login page**, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It serves as a demonstration of my ability to replicate modern web designs and layouts using front-end technologies.

## Project Features

- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: A close replication of Instagramâ€™s clean and minimalist login page, including the logo, input fields, and login button.
- **HTML & CSS Expertise**: Utilized semantic HTML for proper structure and applied CSS for styling, with a focus on achieving a web-accurate design.
- **Image Embedding**: Integrated a mobile device image with an Instagram screenshot inside it, showcasing my understanding of image positioning and overlays using CSS.
- **Hover Effects**: Added subtle hover effects on buttons and input fields to enhance the user interface.
- **Responsiveness**: Designed to be responsive for various screen sizes, ensuring the layout adapts well on smaller devices, with the left container hidden on mobile views and the login form centered.

- `index.html`: The core HTML file for the Instagram login page structure.
